"""
1.  How can you determine how large a tuple is?  Why is this tool located where it is?
    len()
    It is built-in because its use spans many object types.

2.  Write an expression that changes the first term in a tuple.  (4, 5, 6) should become (1, 5, 6) in the process.
    Tuples are immutable, so you'd have to just override the original tuple.

3.  What is the default for the processing module argument in a file open call?
    'r'

4.  What module might you use to store Python objects in a file without converting them to strings yourself?
    pickle

5.  How might you go about coying all prts of a nested structure at once?
    Import the copy module, and call copy.deepcopy()

6.  When does Python consider an object true?
    When it is a nonzero number or a nonempty collection object.

7.  What is your quest?
