1.  Name two ways to build a list containing five integer zeros.
    l = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    l = [0] * 5

2.  Name two ways to build a dictionary with two keys, 'a' and 'b', each having an associated value of 0.
    dict = {'a': 0, 'b': 0}
    dict = {}
    dict['a'] = 0
    dict['b'] = 0

3.  Name four operations that change a list object in place.
    Index and slice assignments
    List method calls
    sort()
    extend()

4.  Name four operations that change a dictionary object in place.
    D['ham'] = ['grill', 'fry']
    del D['eggs']
    D['brunch'] = 'Bacon'
    D.pop('muffin')

5.  Why might you use a dictionary instead of a list?
    Dictionaries are better when the data is labelled.
