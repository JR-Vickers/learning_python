"""
1.  How are lambda expressions and def statements related?
    They both create function objects.

2.  What's the point of using lambda?
    It's an unnamed, or anonymous function.  It's typically used for inline functions.

3.  Compare and contast map, filter, and reduce.
    Map allows you to apply an operation to every item lists or other sequences.
    Filter takes a list and returns a list of all items that pass through a conditional statement.
    Reduce returns the result of the iterables passed through a lambda function.

4.  What are function annotations, and how are they used?
    They are simply additional information attached to functions for use by other tools.

5.  What are recursive functions, and how are they used?
    A recursive function calls itself in order to repeat a given section of code.
    One major use case of recursive functions is to traverse arbitrarily-shaped data structures.

6.  What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?
    They should be relatively short - less than 1 page.

7.  Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.
    return statement
    changing passed-in mutable arguments
    setting global variables
