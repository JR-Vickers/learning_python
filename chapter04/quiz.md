1.  Name four of Python's core data types.
    Numbers
    Strings
    Lists
    Dictionaries

2.  Why are they called "core" data types?
    They are effectively built into the Python language.

3.  What does "immutable" mean, and which three of Python's core types are considered immutable?
    It refers to an object that cannot be changed after it is created.
    Immutable objects consist of strings, numbers, and tuples.

4.  What does "sequence" mean, and which three types fall into that category?
    A sequence is a collection of arbitrarily typed objects.  This includes lists, strings, and tuples.

5.  What does "mapping" mean, and which core type is a mapping?
    Collections of objects stored by key, rather than by relative position.

6.  What is "polymorphism," and why should you care?
    It refers to the fact that the meaning of an operation depends on the object being operated on.  It matters because the same symbol can mean different things in different situations - for instance, if you try to add 2 and 2, you'd expect to get 4.  But if the 2s are strings, then you'd get '22'.
